# Snake_Level_Editor (WIP)
```
A tile editor for my game.
It is working but still some of the features are not implemented such as:
```
```
> Using custom sprites of different sizes
> drag and draw.
> Save to File
```
<b>Different texture sizes are supported but, you would have to manually edit cfg file to define your coordinates as per your source image.</b>
