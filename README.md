# Snake_Level_Editor (WIP)
A tile editor for my game.
It is working but still some of the features are not implemented such as:
<ul>
  <li>Using custom sprites of different sizes.</li>
    <li>drag and draw.</li>
      <li>Save to File
</ul>
<b>Different texture sizes are supported but, you would have to manually edit cfg file to define your coordinates as per your source image.</b>
